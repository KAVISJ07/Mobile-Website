            <p>There is no iPhone 9. After the release of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus in September 2017, Apple skipped directly to the iPhone X (pronounced "ten") in celebration of the iPhone's tenth anniversary. The naming convention continued with the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR in 2018, followed by the iPhone 11 series in 2019. The reasons for skipping the iPhone 9 are speculated to be related to marketing and the significant technological leap represented by the iPhone X.</p>

                 Possible Reasons for Skipping iPhone 9
                1. Marketing Strategy: The jump from iPhone 8 to iPhone X (ten) signified a major leap in technology and design, marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.
                2. Technological Leap: The iPhone X introduced several groundbreaking features, such as:
                   - Edge-to-Edge Display: A nearly bezel-less OLED screen.
                   - Face ID: Advanced facial recognition technology replacing Touch ID.
                   - Removal of Home Button: A new navigation system using gestures.
                   - New Design: A more modern and premium design with stainless steel and glass.
                
             Evolution After iPhone 8
                - iPhone X: Released in November 2017, featuring a 5.8-inch Super Retina display, Face ID, and a new design.
                - iPhone XS and XS Max: Released in September 2018, with improvements in performance, camera, and a larger display for the XS Max.
                - iPhone XR: Also released in September 2018, offering a more affordable option with an LCD display and a variety of colors.
                - iPhone 11 Series: Released in September 2019, with significant improvements in cameras, battery life, and performance.
                  
                By skipping the iPhone 9, Apple aimed to highlight the significant advancements and create a clear distinction between the older models and the innovative features introduced with the iPhone X and subsequent models.</p>
